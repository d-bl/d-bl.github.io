# Abandoned predecessors of GroundForge

These old generators (most recent first) may still have a use case, but they are no longer maintained.

* [Interactive web page](https://jo-pol.github.io/DiBL/grounds/index.html) +
  [InkScape plugin](https://github.com/d-bl/inkscape-bobbinlace/releases/tag/DiBL-Inkscape-0.7.0)   
  Limited set of stitches. Fixed set of patterns. Thread diagrams only from a table of stitches.  
  The plugin can change the thread styles of downloaded diagrams, it is not upgraded to Inkscape 1.0.
* [Desktop application](https://github.com/d-bl/bobbinwork/wiki)   
  Only about a dozen traditional grounds and braids. An export of stitch by stitch images can be imported by third party tools to create an animated image that
  show a working order. You can try to execute it with [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8).
* [Interactive web page](https://jo-pol.github.io/flanders/)   
  Flanders only. No Pair diagrams. Works even with old browsers.
