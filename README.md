Domain knowledge for contributors to any of the projects with little knowledge about (grid based types of) bobbin lace.

## General

The tools provided by D<sub>i</sub>BL are dealing with the following major types of diagrams:

* color coded pair diagrams
* thread diagrams
* prickings

Both types of diagrams are two-in two-out directed graphs. In a pair diagram one line represents two threads: a pair. In a color coded pair diagram the color of an intersection tells a lace maker which stitch to make: how to weave or plait the pairs at that point before grabbing one or two other pairs.

In thread diagrams interruptions of the lines emulate the over under effect of the woven threads. [GroundForge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/) provides topological neutral pair and thread diagrams and a pattern sheet with geometrical variations of the neutral pair diagram. Play around with stitches to see what happens, the most common stitches are tc, ctc and tctc. Note that threads follow another path than a pair when choosing an odd number of c's for a stitch.

A pricking is usually just black and white and applies a third abstraction level. At least it contains dots where the pins should go through the cardboard into the (very stiff) pillow to support the stitches and keep the lace in shape while creating it. Annotations between the dots should keep the lace maker on track.
