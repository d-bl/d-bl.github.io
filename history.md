title: History of D-BL and GroundForge
---

D-BL started as DiBL under google-code. By the time that google-code discontinued,
an account by the name dibl was already taken and the _i_ replaced by a dash.

The dotted  polar grids were exercises to master new technology.

Timeline
--------

* **end of 2001**:  
  The first release for [flanders](https://jo-pol.github.io/flanders/) thread diagrams
* **before 2008**:  
  A [desktop application](https://github.com/d-bl/bobbinwork/wiki)
  with a few more traditional grounds, each predefined with a tedious process and some custom XML.
  This has a textual tree view of the diagrams, drilling down from spider to stitches to cross/twist.
  You can try to execute it with [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8).
* **2013**: 
  * Discovery of PhD research in progress that lead to [tesselace](https://tesselacedotcom.wordpress.com/)
  * Redesign using SVG, a combination of a [web application](https://jo-pol.github.io/DiBL/grounds/index.html) and inkscape plugins  
    this allowed again more patterns but still had a limited choice of stitches 
* **fall 2015**:  
  Proof of concept with [force graphs](glossary),
  Inspiration for this [cheat-sheet](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template.png).  
  Both reduced the burden of complex GUIs with file IO and parsing complex data structures.
* **2017**:
  * Discovery of Jo Edkins' [index](http://www.theedkins.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/index.htm)
    on an out-of-copyright book, the [sampler](https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/collection-insights/2018/gertrude-whiting-bobbin-lace-sampler)
    by Gertrude Whiting.
  * Request for a guinea pig to review GroundForge.
  * Discovery of the Droste effect: using thread diagrams as pair diagrams. 
* **January 2018**
  * More tile configurations than bricks and bathroom.
* **Mid 2019**:
  * Extended the cheat sheet for longer lines between stitches.
* **August 2021**:
  * Tutorials for a workshop at IOLI UnConn 2.0 hosted by _the lace museum_
  * birth of the nets page
* **May 2022**:
  birth of the pdf/print friendly page
* **January 2023**:
  birth of the symmetry page,  
* **mid 2023**:
  Split the main GroundForge page into pattern/stitches/droste
* **fall 2023**
  Recipes for snowflakes without having to distort initial geometry
