title: History of D-BL and GroundForge
---

D-BL started as DiBL under google-code. By the time that google-code discontinued,
an account on GitHub by the name dibl was already taken, so we replaced the _i_ by a dash.

The dotted polar grids were exercises to master new technology.

Timeline
--------

More details in reversed order in the [release notes](https://github.com/d-bl/GroundForge/releases).
The year-quarter notation is a rough indication. The dates of the assets are more exact.

* **end of 2001**:  
  * The first release for [flanders](https://jo-pol.github.io/flanders/) thread diagrams
* **before 2008**:  
  * A [desktop application](https://github.com/d-bl/bobbinwork/wiki)
  with a few more traditional grounds, each predefined with a tedious process and some custom XML.
  This has a textual tree view of the diagrams, drilling down from spider to stitches to cross/twist.
  You can try to execute it with [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8).
* **2013**: 
  * Discovery of PhD research in progress that lead to [tesselace](https://tesselacedotcom.wordpress.com/)
  * Redesign using SVG, a combination of a [web application](https://jo-pol.github.io/DiBL/grounds/index.html) and inkscape plugins.
    This allowed again more patterns but still had a limited choice of stitches 
* **fall 2015**:  
  * Proof of concept with [force graphs](/GroundForge-help/Glossary#force-graphs),
  * Inspiration for this [cheat-sheet](/GroundForge/images/matrix-template.png).  
  Both reduced the burden of complex GUIs with file IO and parsing complex data structures.
* **2017**:
  * Discovery of Jo Edkins' [index](https://www.theedkins.co.uk/jo/lace/whiting/index.htm)
    on an out-of-copyright book, the [sampler](https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/gertrude-whiting-bobbin-lace-sampler)
    by Gertrude Whiting.
  * Request for a guinea pig to review GroundForge.
  * Discovery of the Droste effect: using thread diagrams as pair diagrams. 
* **January 2018**
  * More tile configurations than bricks and bathroom.
* **Mid 2019**:
  * Extended the cheat sheet for longer lines between stitches.
* **August 2021**:
  * Tutorials for a workshop at IOLI UnConn 2.0 hosted by _the lace museum_
  * birth of the nets page
* **May 2022**:
  * birth of the pdf/print friendly page
* **January 2023**:
  * birth of the symmetry page
* **Mid 2023**:
  * Split the main GroundForge page into pattern/stitches/droste.
  * The separated pages are print friendly by themselves.
  * Each of the separated pages has a button that shows/hides applicable help pages, sometimes with half minute video's.
* **Fall 2023**
  * Proof of concept for snowflakes recipes without having to distort initial geometry
* **November 2024**:
  * reduced the all-in-one page to links to the new pages and clean-up
* **December 2024**:
  * Snowflakes recipes integrated into a mixer of four snowflakes
  * Droste page (pair diagrams to thread diagrams) now uses the new color code
* **Early in 2025**:
  * Droste page pair diagrams now are clickable to assign stitches from the gallery
  * Nets page simplified/reorganized
* **Fall 2025**: 
  * Snow mixer has its own sidebar
  * Tutorial to mix snowflakes with more choices than the mixer
